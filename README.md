## Tiling Problem

Given a n by n board where n is of form 2 ^ k where k >= 1 (Basically n is a power of 2 with minimum value as 2). The board has one missing cell (of size 1 x 1). Fill the board using L shaped tiles. A L shaped tile is a 2 x 2 square with one cell of size 1Ã—1 missing.

The program was written in java11 and javafx was used for graphics implementation. Also I used intelliJ community edition IDE.

to recompile and run this program using intelliJ you need to configure javafx.
